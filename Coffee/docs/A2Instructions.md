 # Coffee Gif Browser

## Getting Started

We made our app with React. In order to view our SPA running in the browser, you should do the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/csc309-18s/assignment-2-coffee.git
$ cd assignment-2-coffee
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Your browser should now open the URL `localhost:3000`; where our app lives. A window may pop up asking you to allow incoming connections.
Please click 'yes'.

## Source Code

Source code for all views is located in [src/views](/src/views).
Source code for the header and footer is located in [src/App.js](/src/App.js). The `content` div in `App.js` is
where views are swapped into based on user input. CSS style for all views is located in [src/style](/src/style)
