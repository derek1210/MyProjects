These are the python files for the implmentation of the flow free game.

To run all test case:
  press run or run the main function of solution.py
  
You can run FlowFree.py and on the console run PROBLEMS[n].print_state() to see the nth problem

This is what's in the files:
  FlowFree.py: State functions of flow free. The file contains mainly the implmentation of the game
  search.py: This file is from the starter code of A1
  solution.py: The heuristic that we used are in this file. Also the main funtion to run all the test cases.
