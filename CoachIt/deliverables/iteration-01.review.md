## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 2/9/2017
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

 Need to be more organized, fill out the iteration plan as soon as possible.

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Using tutorial sessions to discuss what we have done, and what we are going to do next
* Using a google doc to exchange information.
* Using Skype to meet, since our schedules seem to conflict.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Attempts to organise by email and google doc have proven to be far too unreliable to be the primary form of communication. Skype communication has had some technical issues during the beginning of the meeting.
 * Postponed filling out the iteration plan to have more time agreeing on a project, didn't have an organized plan to base our work on.
 * Lack of communication, resulting in failure to gather thoughts and ideas properly.
 * Lack of assigned roles, which required more effort on real time coordination
 
#### Planned changes

 * Dividing up the work before we end a meeting to guide team members in their plan of action for the iteration.
 * Decided to use instant messaging (e.g. Facebook, whatsapp) instead of google doc and emails which are really inconvenient.
 * Hatem is going to be in charge of meetings in order to ensure smooth workflow. 
 
## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Finalizing an idea into a concrete plan to develop a website for coaches. 
 * Ilya met with the coach and feedback that was used to further finalize the concept. 

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * We planned on meeting on Saturday the fourth of February, to discuss our brainstormed ideas.
   However, we weren't able to make that meeting due to miscommunication and too short of a notice.
 

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * We will schedule regular meetings and establish efficient ways to communicate. Skype is a good alternative when meeting in person is difficult. 
 * We need to have a more structured division of work in the beginning of the next iteration. For this iteration we were just generating ideas so structure didn't seem really important but for future work more structure would result in more efficient progress. 
 * Our high level concepts' focus will be in front end development such as UX, and back end development involving database, paging, web server etc.
 * For next iteration we will focus on the above mentioned concepts. Each team member would go over these general concepts and we will talk about them in more detail in our following meeting. Then we will divide up the work based on each person's expertise and interest of the concepts.
