#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

   A platform for athletic clubs to help organize the clubs' activities, incorporating its members.
   The product aims to facilitate the different actions done in different platforms, which include planning
   and scheduling events through an event planner, then sending emails to other clubs and club members through an email client.
   The product will be implemented through a website because not all the users will not be using the product in between events
   and the website is platform-independent.
   Common use cases include notifying players and other clubs about events, players confirming their participation in an event, 
   team coaches showing interest to head coaches etc.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

There are three main user profiles that this product will target. Primarily, the product will focus on catering to the needs of the
head coaches. These users take a more administrative role and are expected to be more technologically apt than other users. They are responsible for setting up training sessions, notifying players, organizing events so on and so forth. It would greatly help with their work load management if all the tasks can be organized into one product so they will not have to switch between different tools. 
The second targeted users are the team coaches, who are responsible for confirming with their players and relaying information back to the head coaches. The final user group would be the players of the different teams. They would occasionally use the website to check for more detailed information about the events. However, they will not be frequent users of the interface and just need a quick and easy way of confirming their attendance to an event.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

The application attempts to provide a unified interface for the logistical issues that arise when sporting clubs try to organize events.
Currently, there exists an application for a club to book a venue that other clubs can check, but it requires manual relay of information from the club head coaches to the team coaches. Then the team coaches need to run after players and get their confirmation in participating for an event, individually. By having an auto email notification system that sends these messages to the teams when an event is scheduled, the information is properly relayed with minimized human intervention.


### Highlights

 * [Insight]Our product needs to provide Efficiency and Convenience for both coaches and players. Players are not like coaches, who rely on this product to organize multiple events. They simply need to confirm training, confirm their participation in events, and pay a fee at times. Basically, it is sufficient for them to just react to what the coach posts. The simple demands would make them unwilling to check the website as frequently as their coach. Therefore we decided to keep them notified by email and provide confirmation links in those emails.
 
 * [Insight]Credibility of coaches and players needs to be considered. Our product interacts with people in actual activities. We need to avoid situations wherein a random person who is neither a player nor a coach signs up for an event he or she does not have access to. To make sure that people are serious and can be held responsible, we check and keep a record of both the players' and coaches' identity. Therefore, our product would validate the license of coaches upon their registration. Validated coaches are then allowed to form groups of their players. In this situation, the players' identity are also controlled through the coaches. 

* [Decision]For our product we had two alternatives to either develop a software application or a website. An application would be useful for someone who checks things frequently, but it is more platform dependent and we would risk having a smaller user space. Websites are more compatible across devices, appealing to more traditional users. Our final decision is to develop a website as we have a large user space, comprised mostly of players. We think that the players' convenience and accessibility is far more important than lots of combined functionalities. We might develop an app for coaches if time permits.
