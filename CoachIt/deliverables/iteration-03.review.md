## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 23rd
 * Where: BA2175

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

 
 * Having coding sessions instead of just meetings turned out well, since problems were immediately brought up. Communication was enhanced and team members could help each other while working on the same page. We made a lot more progress during coding sessions than we've made individually. This fulfilled our goal of having team members to be more active and engaging. 
 
 * We decided to use Facebook messenger as instant communication tool and got rid of the original google doc. This turned out to be a good decision as team members check for messages more frequently, especially when we were coordinating meeting times and adjusting plans. 

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 
 * Re-organization of teams did not turn out as planned. We had in mind a clear division of front-end and back-end teams and responsibilities that were associated with each team. However, the issues in back-end required lots of effort and some front-end members realized there wasn't much to do until the back-end issues get solved. So basically everyone worked on back-end and did minimal improvements as planned on the front-end. 
 * Another decision that did not turn out well was that some team members had no prior knowledge or experience for certain tools we planned to use. So the detailed division of work did not work out realistically. 
 * We did not make the video or do the review according to schedule. This is partly due to receiving feedback notes on the second video later than expected, and also due to the fact that we were working on back-end extensively. 


#### Planned changes


 * We plan to have a smaller team for front-end and larger team for back-end. It turns out from this iteration onwards, there is still a lot of work to be done in the back-end and those issues take a longer time to resolve. 
 * We are at a point where the product features are finalized. So we decide to spend more time on the current features and their functionality rather than planning for extra features.
 * There will be no more Skype meetings, because they weren't as efficient or engaging as coding sessions.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
 
 Our goals from the plan were:
 * Upload our webpage so it is publicly accessible: This task was fully done. We uploaded our webpage through heroku. Link to our webpage: https://coach-it.herokuapp.com
 * Create an interface for the database: It's done at the moment but we might change it.
 * Make another demo video: completed with a link to video: https://youtu.be/YygOX6Nwzvc
 * Build up our technical knowledge: this goal is mostly met.
 
 Tasks that were not in the original plan:
 * Making the navigation bar independent of the HTML pages, instead generated on page load through Javascript.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Handle client request other than static pages(backend): We haven't got there because we were still trying to interact with the database. 
 * Formulate the page(frontend): partially done. Because we mainly pooled our efforts into the back-end. 
   

## Meeting Highlights

 
  * There is apparently more work on the backend to be done than we initially thought.
  * The overhead of learning new things is larger than expected.
