## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 3/9/2017
 * Where: BA2165

## Process - Reflection

Our process generally went as planned. The subgroup in charge of the front end achieved their goals and the backend subgroup had some setbacks when setting things up. So the members from front end were also able to help work on the backend. It is crucial for each group member to know the extent of their individual tasks and where other members are at. It is also helpful that new issues are created as tasks and assigned to particular team members to make sure they are taken care of. The structured planning for tasks and events we came up with during our initial meeting really helped with the process of this iteration. 

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Having regular meetings as planned, including both online meetings and in person coding sessions. Usage of instant messaging to communicate has helped to keep everyone on track.
* Github workflow decisions of having pull requests merged by other members of the same subgroup, so changes are double checked before merging to avoid possible conflicts and failures.
* Using Github enhancing issues to create new tasks and assign to team members. It turned out to be a good decision as new tasks always come up during the working process. 
* We had more structured division of work by separating the entire group into two subgroups managing front end and backend. As a result we were more efficient than last iteration. 
* Eventually decided to use Java's Spark framework which works as expected so far. 

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * The decision to use python and Django didn't work out because team members had different environments. It took too long to integrate and we eventually decided to switch. Another issue was the lack of knowledge of Django's framework.
 * Many issues on github were not closed. 
 
 
#### Planned changes

 * Make planning meetings shorter and more precise, increase number of coding meetings 
 
## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Create static html pages(login, dashboard, event creation/check)
 * Make the video demo for the deliverable.
 * Come up with creative ideas.
 * Our ideas include: Implement a confirm button in the email sent to players. As a result, players can just click one button without connecting to any links or open webpages which is gives them a much better user experience.
  

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Find a free web hosting service
 * Find a database hosting

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Team members should be more active closing issues. The issues should be made more practical and detailed as well. 
 * Into the next iteration we will have more coding to do. We would make sure each team member does a fair amount of coding.
