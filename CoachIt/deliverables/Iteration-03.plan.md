# Coachit/Group 12
## Iteration 3

 * Start date: 3/13/17
 * End date: 3/23/17

## Process


#### Changes from previous iteration


 
 * Give deadlines for issues since in the previous iteration issues weren't handled properly. 
 * Group members are encouraged to be more active, especially when we get stuck on certain issues. We will have coding sessions where people work together in a more engaging process. 
 
#### Roles & responsibilities


* new back-end team: Christon, Zhihan, Melanie
* new front-end team: Illya, Hatem, Dereck. 
* responsibilities associated with front-end team: create pages that users can interact with.
* responsibilities associated with back-end team: create an interface for the front-end developers. 

#### Events


 * Monday(3/13): Planning meeting 
 * Thursday(3/16): optional coding session
 * Saturday(3/18): whole team meeting with coding sessions 
 * Monday(3/20): video meeting. Thursday(3/23): final review of iteration 3. 
 * Aside from meetings that involve the whole team, we are going to have pair programming or small group programming sessions that involves team members who are working on a similar task. These sessions will be scheduled between members within their teams.
 

#### Artifacts
    
   * Responsibilities in the planning document of this iteration will be used as a guideline for the two teams.
   * Github issues are used as task board. Same as last iteration.
   * Facebook messenger used as instant communication and Skype for meetings. 
  

#### Git / GitHub workflow
 
 * Same as previous iteration but with a bit more elaboration based on feedback. Using github issues as a task-board gives other members a sense of what the other members are currently working on. Dealing with conflicts was mostly non-existant since having members working on their own forks allows them to work and start a pull request without altering the team repository. Having other members merge that pull request allows two people to look over the code which allows quicker discovery and resolution of bugs.
