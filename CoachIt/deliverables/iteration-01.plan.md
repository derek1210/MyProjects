# Coachit/Group 12


## Iteration 01

 * Start date: Monday, January 30, during tutorial
 * End date: Thursday, February 9, skype conference.

## Process


#### Roles & responsibilities

Due to an unclear starting path into our project, the responsibility of all team members was to mainly brainstorm different ideas.
Ilya, also, plans to speak to a coach to identify problems to help come up with our product.

#### Events

Meetings:
  Monday, Jan 30(tutorial)
  Weekend, Feb 3-5?
  Monday, Feb 6(tutorial)
  Thursday, Feb 9(skype)

#### Artifacts       

  Using a google doc(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1YhjqxpcvAsT1UMDlt6TcwDBBug11KcSiBLmgFA4BU),
  and emails to exchange availability among us, and decide on when to meet.

  We decided to use github issues to keep track of what needs to be done.
  Still need to decide on how to prioritize tasks, and how we assign task to team members.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

  This iteration our goal is to decide on a project that we all agree to work on.
  Our possible options from the first meeting are: 
  
    * password manager: browser extension to protect a password.
    
    * event meetups: platform to meet with others who share an interest(ex: going to a movie)
    
    * calendar scheduler: an app that helps a user to organize their tasks and plan ahead
    
    * coach email app: help coaches to facilitate and organize events.

  We decided that we will think and gather information on one of those ideas to make a descision by the next meeting.

#### Artifacts

  The main intuition at the time was that all ideas could be done using an application.
  So for the password manager, we thought of building a browser extension.
  The calendar scheduler would be more beneficial as a mobile application, so we considered creating a primary Android version.
  For the other two ideas, we concluded that a desktop application would be sufficient.
