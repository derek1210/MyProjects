#### Artifacts    

 * We will use facebook group to communicate.
 * We will use github enhancement issues to assign tasks during monday meetings, this will be our to do list.
 * Assignment of task will be based on the subgroupings, front end, and back end.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

 * Merge forks into development branch, we will fast forward master when we meet.
 * Pull requests are done by other members in the same subgroup.
 * Code conflicts will be notified on facebook, and resolved during meetings if needed
 
We think this will allow us to get familliar with each others coding habits,
and it follows good coding practices.
