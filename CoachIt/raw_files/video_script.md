## Introduction (30-45 seconds):

In this day and age of instant connectivity, sports clubs still waste precious practise time on administrative issues relating their team members activities.
In particular events that include not only their team, but also require communication with other clubs.

“Coach It” is a platform used to simplify the process of event planning for sports clubs and take off the administrative burden that coaches have to manage on a regular basis. This application sets up an efficient communication channel between coaches and players, as well as between different clubs that want to participate in tournaments. Let's start with Mike. 

## Demo (1.5 - 2 minutes):
Mike is a coach for club Maverick. He wants to set up the upcoming annual winter classics tournament. He invites other clubs in the region to join by creating the event. He enters details like the date of the event, the team category, gender of players, and adds an interesting description to entice other coaches to want to enroll their team. When he clicks create, invitations will automatically be sent to all the coaches.
Lisa, one of the coaches at Shadow sees the event Mike just created. She thinks her players would like to participate in this year's winter classic winter. All She has to do is express interest by clicking the inform button, and email invitations will automatically be sent to each member of her team. 

Now, Jennifer who plays for Shadow, receives an email asking her to confirm her availability instantly by clicking on the available button.
If Lisa's team has enough players that have confirmed their availability in this year's winter classics, she will be able to confirm her entire team's participation in the event.

Finally, Mike can see that enough teams have confirmed interest in participating, he is now able to confirm the event and start planning logistics of making the tournament happen. He can gather information like the time that works best among the confirmed teams, the costs and other details.  

## Final discussion (30-45 seconds)
Coach It currently deals with just the planning and setting up of the event but in future features, we plan to include a scheduling feature that can  schedule and match teams up against each other to lay out the tournament.  
Allowing coaches to communicate with the creator of the event will also be implemented in the next release.
