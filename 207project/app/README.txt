To run the app:

Our project is named "TriageApplication" which is placed in the root of our repository. To launch the application, run the main activity. If this doesn't work, make sure that the patient_records.txt file appears in the /data/data/csc207.group0944.triageapplication/files directory. If the file appears here but is empty for whatever reason, remove it and push the correct file to the device. I have tried pushing files into my own device with no success (I suspect this is because my device is not rooted). If this happens, use the emulator instead. We used the Galaxy Nexus, although any virtual device should work. If this still doesn't work, email jurgen.aliaj@mail.utoronto.ca.

To use the app:

Using the app is quite straight forward. The main activity is a screen which displays a list of all recorded patients. The user can click on a given patient to access their record. Alternatively, the user can use the search box by entering the health card number of the patient they wish to look up. Once in the patient's record, the user can add visits by specifying a date which corresponds to the patient's arrival time at the hospital. This creates an empty visit which will be listed on the screen. To start updating the visit information, the user should click on the date of the visit they just created which will bring them to another screen. Here the user can start updating the information of the visit (only the vital signs of the patient can be modified in this phase) by specifying the time at which the vital signs were observed and by specifying various other information (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate). There is no need for the user to save any information manually. All information will be automatically saved by the app once created.
