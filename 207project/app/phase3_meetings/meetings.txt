November 17 Planning:

a)
-The project from phase 2 is working and functional.

b)
-We plan to complete all the back-end for the phase 3 by the next planning meeting. 
-This includes new classes for the Nurse, Physician and abstract class User.
-In addition, we expect to complete the sorted by urgency requirement.
-Finally, we should be able to add attributes to the PatientRecord class which  records whether or not a patient has been seen by a doctor, urgency, and all prescription information.
-We will deal with the front-end after we complete all of these requirements.

c) (not final yet)
-Alex will complete the Nurse, Physician and User classes.
-Jurgen will complete the sorting (and categorizing) requirement.
-Raymond and Derek will update the new PatientRecord class (Will need to implement HospitalPolicy interface to complete urgency requirement).
