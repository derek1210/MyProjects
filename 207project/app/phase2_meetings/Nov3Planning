Planning Meeting:

a) - We have merged our design from phase 1 and are ready to start planning on splitting the work.

b)
- We plan to complete features #1 and #2 by Thursday, and we will handle the rest afterwards. (If we have time, we will try to work on the VisitRecord class)

c) 
- Raymond and Derek will create the PatientRecord class described in our CRC model.
- Jurgen will handle feature #1 on the feature list by creating a TriageApplication class which will load patient records to the system.
- Alex will handle feature #2 on the feature list by creating a linear search function which scans all the health card numbers of the patients.
