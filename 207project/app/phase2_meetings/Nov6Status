Status Meeting:

a)
-Completed the PatientRecord class
-Completed part of feature #1 and #2 (we can load the patients from the text file but still need to complete the GUI)
-Still need to add a search function to search up patients

In other words, we've completed everything we planned on Monday except for the GUI and search function.

b)
-We plan to complete the things we did not complete from last time, and complete the VisitRecord class along with a function to save visit records to a file (i.e. the reamining 4 features).

c)
No problems/obstacles preventing us from making progress (apart from lack of time).
